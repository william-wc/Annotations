# How to study

## Step 1 - Audit Yourself

Objectivize and analyze your routine, find the biggest pain points

- Keep a journal/notes over the course of the day

## Step 2 - Use the Power of Language

Make small adjustments

Use the word `and` instead of `but`:

```
I have to study for my midterm,
[but|and]
I'm tired and I don't feel like it
```

This is to avoid two phrases that conflict each other

## Setp 3 - Lower the Activation Energy

> Starting is the hardest part

Take a task and subdivide into smaller parts, after that break it into even smaller parts

Use the same technique with time management, with regular breaks in between

- If possible, choose small tasks to be done first, to build momentum
- Lower your expectations of the task, make it so that starting it will become easier:
    - I have to write the first paragraph of an essay and it **will be bad** (makes it easier to start)

## Step 4 - Add Some Spice

- If getting too tired or bored of the same subject, then vary the *type of study* or *subject matter*
    **Pomodoro technique**

- Incentivize yourself with rewards
    After finishing a daunting task for long periods of time, give yourself a treat, or do something else entirely (to rest)

- Move
    Moving to a new location usually helps to start anew
